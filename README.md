# Technical Documentation Page

This project creates a technical documentation page using HTML and CSS.

**Deployment Link:** [https://responsive-side-navbar.netlify.app](https://responsive-side-navbar.netlify.app)

## Overview

The page contains a side navigation menu that allows clicking through different sections covering CSS topics. The sections have header tags and paragraphs explaining the topic.

The side navbar starts fixed/sticky on desktop screens and transitions to the top on mobile widths. Media queries are used to change styling between desktop and mobile views.

### Some key features:

- Mobile responsive design with media queries
- Sticky side navbar for desktop screens
- Semantic HTML including header, nav, section, etc.
